``dqcs`` is a handy little tool for those who **love** QEMU but find themselves **cursing** the SPICE (performance issues). After stumbling upon SDL, I was amazed. No glitches, smooth as butter, nearly perfect. The only catch? No clipboard sharing... yet. So, I whipped up this quick-and-dirty fix using ``virtio-serial`` to fill that gap until SDL adds native clipboard support. Enjoy! Or don't. But I think you should at least try.


## âš¡ Features

The structure of the project is pretty simple:
- a component that runs on the host
- a component that runs on the guest
- a ``virtio-serial`` device for the communication between the two components.

The following is a list of the features (both planned and implemented):
- [x] Allow bidirectional copy between Linux host and Linux guest
- [x] Allow bidirectional copy between Linux host and Windows guest 
- [ ] Command to quickly generate a Linux service file
- [ ] Command to quickly add a Windows Service
- [ ] Allow image clipboard sharing

## ðŸ“š Usage

```
dqcs -h
```

This will display the help for the tool

v0.0.1 - https://github.com/thelicato/dqcs

Dummy QEMU Clipboard Sharing for those who don't like SPICE

Usage:
  dqcs [flags]
  dqcs [command]

Available Commands:
  guest       Run the DQCS host component
  help        Help about any command
  host        Run the DQCS host component

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for dqcs

Use "dqcs [command] --help" for more information about a command.

```

The help is pretty self-explainatory, the correct order is the following:
1. Run ``dqcs host``
2. Start QEMU with a ``virtio-serial`` device
3. Run ``dqcs guest`` in the QEMU VM

### Configure QEMU

TODO!

### Setup a Linux Service

Here is a sample Linux service that you can use to automate the usage:

```
[Unit]
Description=dqcs
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/dqcs guest # Edit with the correct 'dqcs' binary location
Restart=on-failure
User=root
Environment=PATH=/usr/bin:/bin
Environment=DISPLAY=:1 # Edit this
Environment=XAUTHORITY=/run/usr/1000/gdm/Xauthority # Edit this
WorkingDirectory=/root

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

To create a Linux service:
1. Create a ``dqcs.service`` file in ``/etc/systemd/system`` with the above content
2. Reload the available service with ``systemctl daemon-reload``
3. Start the ``dqcs.service`` with ``systemctl start dqcs``
4. Check the current status of the service with ``systemctl status dqcs``
5. Enable autostart with ``systemctl enable dqcs``


## ðŸš€ Installation

Run the following command to install the latest version:

```
go install github.com/thelicato/dqcs@latest
```

Or you can simply grab an executable from the [Releases](https://github.com/thelicato/dqcs/releases) page.
